        <h3>{About me}</h3>
        <p>Howdy!!! I am a Electronic Systems Engineer from Fort Worth, Texas. For my entire life I've had a passion for learning about how things work and building new things. I got my first job at the age of 15 working as a busboy at a Italian restaurant, And with that first job I build my very first computer.  Building my computer gave me a new perspective on how computer hardware and software works, and with this new knowledge I began to learn how to code. I have now finished high school have have set my path to become a computer engineer. My path is now set to spend the next 4 years at Texas A&M University, I am very proud to call myself an Aggie. {Gig em!!}</p>
        <p>As a student of A&M and Regent Scholar, A&M offered me to take a Engineering Summer Bridge Program funded personaly by AT&T and the Zachry Group. This opportunity help young engineers experience the university life, explore campus and offered us an opportunity to take calculus I. This opportunity is helping use prepare for the real world and the great retirement of baby boomer engineers in which will provide a large number of engineering jobs across America. </p>
